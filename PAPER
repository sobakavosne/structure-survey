TITLE(2/2):     The impact of function implementation on performance of a Persistent 
                Data Structure processing

ABSTRACT:       The research is aimed to find quantitative (structure size) and qualitative  
                (implementation) dependencies for persistent data structures on JavaScript 
                V8 execution via Node.js

NOTE:           This is only about pure functional not about imperative 
                (On each level of implementation as possible)

LIBRARIES:      Mori vs. Lazy vs. Native vs. Immutable

FUNCTIONS:      Ramda vs. Lodash vs. Underscore vs. Native vs. C++ Addon

MOTIVATION:     Find the real-world difference between functional implementations 

QUESTION:       Who's better uses JavaScript? 

MACHINE:        Intel i5-2450M (4) @ 3.100 GHz | 12 GB | Samsung SSD 860 (550/520 MB/sec)

BENCHMARK:      Absolute values -> ops/sec over a call => higher is better

ABBREVIATIONS:  DS - (Persistent) Data Structure (in Native case: used as a persistent)
                IO - Input/Output (Monad)

Part #1.  Introduction

  To start our research we have to find out what do mean keywords from the LIBRARIES 
  and FUNCTIONS sectionsand briefly what is under the hood.

  DS libraries:

  - [Mori](http://swannodette.github.io/mori/): 
      Core is written in ClojureScript (JS platform for Clojure) => evaluation phases: 
        Clojure -> ClojureScript -> JavaScript -> execution

  - [Lazy](https://danieltao.com/lazy.js/):
      Core is written in JavaScript => evaluation phases: 
        JavaScript -> execution

  - [Native](https://www.javascript.com/):
      JavaScript in-built DSs => evaluation phases: 
        'direct' execution

  - [Immutable](https://immutable-js.com/):
      Core is written in TypeScript => evaluation phases: 
        TypeScript -> JavaScript -> execution

  Function libraries:

  - [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/):
      Core is written in JavaScript           => evaluation phases: 
        JavaScript -> execution

  - [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
      Core is written in JavaScript           => evaluation phases: 
        JavaScript -> execution

  - [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
      Core is written in JavaScript           => evaluation phases: 
        JavaScript -> execution

  - [Native](https://www.javascript.com/):
      JavaScript in-built function interface  => evaluation phases: 
        direct execution

  - [C++Addon](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html):
      Node.js in-built API => evaluation phases: 
        C++ -> Node API (ES "Agent") -> JavaScript -> execution

Part #2.  Data grid description

  Parameters: 

    fnc   - Function used to iterate over a DS
    lib   - Type of the library from which function is originated
    iter  - Number of iterations over a DS: 0 - just generation, 1 ...
    size  - Size of a DS

  Data Structure implementation:  | Function implementation:
                                  |
    Mori      - Green             |   Ramda       - Green
    Lazy      - Grey              |   Lodash      - Grey
    Native    - Yellow            |   Native      - Yellow 
    Immutable - Red               |   Underscore  - Blue
                                  |   C++ Addon   - Red

  Result form (3d-presented):     | Cases:
                                  | 
    X - size, items               |   Structure library - Functions
    Y - iteration, times          |   Function library  - Structures
    Z - speed, op/sec             |

Part #5.  Evaluation

  There is an unused module - `source/struct-master/data-struct/data.struct.js` - occurred 
  during the development. I've found I don't need to use it, but some results was obtained.
  Let's suppose, we replace the direct generation of DSs 
  (in actual module `source/struct-master/bench-suite/suite.generator.js`) with a reference 
  to the `required` module with prebuilt DSs for better semantics. My first thoughts was 
  "this is FP, and nothing can be changed in a transparent lambda-call":

  ```js
    `~ source/struct-master/bench-suite/suite.generator.js`

    ...
    const DS = require('../data-struct/data.struct')
    ...
    const listSuiteConstructorIO =
    ...
              .add('Mori       ', () => MORI.intoArray(SG_HANDLER.repeatMoriMap(iterations, DS.M_LIST, fnc)))
              .add('Lazy       ', () => SG_HANDLER.repeatMap(iterations, DS.L_LIST, fnc).toArray())
              .add('Native     ', () => SG_HANDLER.repeatMap(iterations, DS.N_LIST, fnc))
              .add('Immutable  ', () => SG_HANDLER.repeatMap(iterations, DS.I_LIST, fnc).toArray())
    ...
  ```

  But suddenly, the results were slightly (even much) different ('0 iterations' means there 
  is no iterations over the DS = just DS generation):

  ```text
    -- (a) Module 'preloaded' DSs:
    0 iterations via  Add. Structure size: 10 000
       Mori        x 2,152 ops/sec ±3.44% (82 runs sampled)
       Lazy        x 477 ops/sec ±1.98% (86 runs sampled)
       Native      x 610,005,526 ops/sec ±1.88% (79 runs sampled)
       Immutable   x 17,821 ops/sec ±3.35% (85 runs sampled)
     Fastest is Native     

    -- (b) Direct generated DSs:
    0 iterations via  Add. Structure size: 10 000
       Mori        x 497 ops/sec ±2.22% (76 runs sampled)
       Lazy        x 461 ops/sec ±2.89% (83 runs sampled)
       Native      x 9,394 ops/sec ±15.93% (85 runs sampled)
       Immutable   x 16,258 ops/sec ±3.62% (80 runs sampled)
     Fastest is Immutable
  ```

  Legend: (a) pre-built call, (b) in-built call.

  ```text
    Native:
      (a) 610,005,526 ops/sec   - JS fully evaluates native code while it's loaded with `require` 
                                  and runs conditionally `empty` test
           >>
      (b) 9,394 ops/sec         - JS manages function tree as an argument

    Lazy:
      (a) 477 ops/sec           - JS generates lazy list loaded via 'require', but doesn't run it 
                                  until list becomes an argument
           ≈
      (b) 461 ops/sec           - JS manages lazy list as an argument. Almost the same because of the 
                                  transparent JS

    Immutable:
      (a) 17,821 ops/sec        - TypeScript sugar compiles before loading
           >≈
      (b) 16,258 ops/sec        - TypeScript is processed inside the call

    Mori:
      (a) 2,152 ops/sec         - Clojure compilation is occurred in module pre-builing
           >
      (b) 497 ops/sec           - Clojure is processed inside the call
  ```

  Native pre-build (a) DS approaches infinity because there is nothing to call - list is already an array.
  Lazy DS are almost the same because of the laziness: the difference is a time for drawing function tree.
  Immutable and Mori have foreing convertion which is occurred with a first call.

> Regarding Part #5: The difference between pre-loaded structures and their direct calls is a time for 
foreign language processing.
